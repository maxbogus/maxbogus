🌱 Career Trajectory & Vision
Current Path → CTO/CPTO:

Head of Frontend Development (current) — Pure technical leadership in one domain

Product Engineer / Technical Program Manager (next 12-18 months) — Hybrid role with P&L responsibility

VP Engineering / CTO (2027+) — Executive leadership with strategic scope

Why this progression? Building executive capabilities while maintaining technical credibility. The TPM/Product Engineer role bridges pure engineering and business leadership—essential for sustainable CTO paths.
