🌱 Career Trajectory: 2012 → 2027
Stage	Role	Focus	When
Past	Chief Quality Officer (Banki.ru)	Board-level, P&L, C-suite strategy	2012-2016
Current	Head of Frontend Development (ATOM)	Technical leadership in one vertical	2023-now
Next	Product Engineer / TPM	P&L, cross-functional, metrics, delivery	2025-2026
Target	VP Engineering / CTO	Executive strategy, board, hiring, scaling	2026-2027
Why this progression?
I've already had board-level experience at 27-28 — the gap isn't "learning executive skills," it's scaling those skills from one department to full company scope. TPM/Product Engineer bridges pure engineering to business leadership.

💡 Unique Background (< 1% of market)
Early executive experience: Board-level strategic partner at 27-28 (Banki.ru) with full P&L, C-suite contact, company-wide influence

Law + Tech + AI: Criminology degree + AI steganography + 20+ years engineering → seeing technology through risk & strategy lens

Fintech + Medical + Automotive: Regulated sectors + production systems + critical infrastructure (BCS, Align Tech, Banki.ru, ATOM)

International + Domestic: 5 years Silicon Valley (Align Tech, FDA) + Russia's import-substitution (ATOM)

MBA + Master's: Continuous strategic thinking development (Financial U + MGIMO)

This combination lets me see technology through the lens of risk, strategy, and business impact — key CTO/CPTO skills.

💬 Topics I Love Discussing
Tech leadership: Scaling teams (1→50+), psychological safety, conflict resolution

Frontend architecture: Microfrontends, SSR, performance at scale

System design & DevOps: Reliability, cost optimization, infrastructure

Product thinking: MVP delivery, metrics, user research, TPM competencies

Career transitions: IC → Manager → VP → CTO

AI integration: LLM applications, skepticism, realistic ROI

Executive skills: P&L management, board communication, strategic planning

Russia's tech ecosystem: Import-substitution, tech sovereignty

Sustainable leadership: Ambition + family + work-life balance

🎯 Core Values
Executive Thinking: 90-95% ready for CTO/VP Engineering — not "aspiring," but deliberately building missing 5-10%

Evidence-Based: Strategic decisions backed by metrics, not hype (AI skepticism, TCO/ROI focus)

People-First: 5% retention proves: great products come from thriving teams, not burnout

Continuous Growth: MBA + Master's + public speaking + mentorship = learning velocity

Family Balance: Serious ambition AND quality time with family (non-negotiable)

Transparency: Share wins and failures equally — that's how we all grow
