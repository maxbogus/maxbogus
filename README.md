Executive-level Principal Engineer (21+ years) | Head of Frontend @ ATOM.auto | Board-level & P&L experience (Banki.ru, age 27–28). Bridging engineering, product and business on the path to VP Engineering / CTO via Product Engineering and Head of Platform.

What I Do
- Build & scale products: from MVP to high-load platforms (1000+ RPS, 25M+ users, 99.7% uptime).
- Lead and grow teams: from 0/1 to 50+ engineers, 5% attrition vs 15–20% industry average, culture of psychological safety.
- Optimize costs & infrastructure: AWS, Kubernetes, smart migrations, up to −75% infrastructure costs, millions $ equivalent in savings.
- Architect scalable systems: TypeScript, React, Node.js, Microfrontends, SSR, high-load, observability, CI/CD.
- Drive executive strategy: P&L, unit economics, board-level decisions, AI/ML and LLM integration into product and processes.

Current Mission
- Lead frontend architecture & platform @ ATOM.auto (automotive/fintech ecosystem, 5M+ users, focus on tech sovereignty).
- Build "Head of Platform" function: platform as product, metrics for ROI, adoption, developer experience.
- Teach & mentor: MGIMO, Bauman University, conferences (TeamLead, SQA Days, etc.), developing next generation of tech leads.
- AI & risk: practical LLM integration (GigaChat etc.) + research in AI-steganography, cybersecurity and AI-hype skepticism.

Tech Stack & Strengths
- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Kotlin.
- Frontend: React ecosystem, Redux/Zustand, React Query, Microfrontends, SSR, Core Web Vitals, design systems.
- Backend & Infra: Node.js/NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub Actions, cost-aware DevOps.
- Strengths: System architecture, high-load & FinTech, product strategy, team building, managing managers (through tech leads), board-level communication and P&L.

Impact & Track Record
- High load & FinTech: 1000+ RPS, 11–25M users; brokerage platforms with quarterly volume >10 trillion RUB.
- Safety-critical: Boeing WIRS (avionics), Acronis (5M B2C / 750K B2B), Align (FDA compliance, 15 languages), zero-tolerance for critical bugs.
- Reliability & costs: 99.7% uptime, −80% critical incidents, −75% infrastructure costs, −60% analytics SaaS spend, ~5M+ RUB/year in fraud protection value.
- Org scale: 0→11 QA (Banki.ru), 0→10 full-stack (Gett), >3 engineers developed to tech leads and leadership roles.

Executive: Chief Quality Officer @ Banki.ru (age 27–28) with full P&L (300–500K$/year), board-level decisions and release veto power.

Education & Background
- MBA — Financial University (2025).
- Master's — MGIMO, Digital Product Management (graduation 2027).
- Engineering — Bauman MSTU, Software Engineering.
- Law — MIEMP, criminal law & cybercrime; research in AI-steganography and cybersecurity → tech leadership through the lens of risk and sovereignty.

Career Trajectory & Next Step
- Path: QA & Safety-Critical → Chief Quality Officer (board-level, P&L) → Head of Frontend (Principal-level IC) → Head of Platform / Product Engineer → VP Engineering / CTO.
- Current: Staff/Principal-level Head of Frontend @ ATOM.auto, managing 8 engineers through tech leads and standards, effectively 100+ engineers through quality gates and architecture.
- Next step: formalize Principal Engineer + transition to Head of Platform with 1–2 managers and 5–10 engineers as a bridge to VP Engineering.

Core Values
Evidence-based strategy and ROI, healthy skepticism toward hype, sustainable teams, transparency, family priorities and long-term horizon.
